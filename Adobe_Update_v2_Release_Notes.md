# Release Notes: Adobe Subscription Management Update v2

## Overview

We're excited to announce significant enhancements to Adobe subscription management capabilities. This release introduces comprehensive self-service options for managing Adobe products, eliminating the need for manual workarounds and reducing dependency on technical support for common subscription operations.

---

## Problem Solved

Previously, partners faced limitations when managing Adobe subscriptions, requiring manual intervention for common tasks such as:

- Scheduling new Adobe products at renewal
- Adjusting renewal quantities
- Modifying licenses within 3YC (3-Year Commit) commitment buckets
- Combining multiple products to qualify for volume discounts
- Handling late renewals
- Syncing subscription discrepancies

These limitations forced partners to rely on:
- Manual Adobe API calls
- AppDirect technical representatives
- Soft cancellations and re-migrations

**This release eliminates these workarounds** by providing a dedicated platform experience that streamlines operations and reduces manual intervention.
